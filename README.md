# Text Summarization 

*Automatic Summarization: Automatic summarization is the process of shortening a set of text computationally, to create a subset that represents the most important or relevant information within the original content.*

Text summarization is classified into two types â€” __Extractive__ *and* __Abstractive Summarization__.
1.	Extractive Summarization: The extractive text summarization process extracts the main points of a text without any alteration to those points and rearranging the order of that points and the grammar to get the soul out of the summary.
2.	Abstractive Summarization: The Abstractive methods use advanced techniques to get a whole new summary. Some parts of this summary might not even appear within the original text.
