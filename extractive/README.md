# Extractive Text Summarization

Here I am using TF-IDF algorithm along with Gensim and Sumy Summarizer to generate extractive summary of a long text.

1. extractive_summarizer.py - This python script covers the basic code for all the three aforesaid implementations in object oriented programming style.
2. extractive_app.py - This script is a streamlit implementation to presention the solution as an app.

#### To run the code:
*streamlit run extractive_app.py*
 
 #### Hardcoded Implementation can also be run:
 *python extractive_summarizer.py*
